Hi, I’m Hossein Baghaei, a passionate Electronic Engineer and Embedded Systems Designer with a Master's degree in Embedded Systems Design and a Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering. I have over four years of experience creating innovative solutions in IoT, automation, and smart grid projects.

My expertise lies in developing embedded software, designing PCBs, and integrating advanced hardware systems. I thrive on solving complex engineering challenges, leveraging my proficiency in C, FreeRTOS, and various microcontroller ecosystems, including STM32 and Raspberry Pi.

I’m particularly interested in exploring the intersection of hardware and software, building systems that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. My recent projects include smart grid technologies, intelligent irrigation systems, and advanced sensing solutions, all of which highlight my ability to deliver impactful results.

When I’m not coding or designing circuits, you’ll find me hiking, biking, or watching movies. Feel free to connect—I’m always open to discussing technology, innovation, or potential collaborations!
